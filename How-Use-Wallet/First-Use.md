# ELECTRON WALLET
### Download the wallet from the official Radiantblockchain website:

URL: https://github.com/RadiantBlockchain/electron-radiant/releases

For this guide I recommend the portable version because it does not require installation. This allows you to move it to another pc or make a backup in a simple way.

The first time it is run, it will be necessary to accept the Windows warning. It is also possible that the antivirus says that it may have a Trojan, but it is a false-positive.

And click in Run anyway

The next step is to indicate how to connect the wallet. By default it is correct

Now it is time to create a new wallet and it is necessary to give it a name. To load a backup, it would be necessary to load the file of the wallet

Radiant only works with standard wallets, which is the one to dial. To retrieve a specific private key, it would be option 3

In the next step we have two important options to choose from. Restore a wallet with the saved words or generate a new one.

In this case we select a new one:
1. Create new seed
2. Restore seed.

The words that appear will be the seed of the new portfolio. It is necessary and obligatory to write them down or copy them to a file. If they are lost, you will lose access to any radiant in the addresses of the portfolio.

### **IMPORTANT: MAKE SEVERAL BACKUP COPIES OF THESE WORDS**

To ensure that the words are copied correctly, you are asked to enter them all in the following step

And the last step is to generate a password that encrypts the wallet.
